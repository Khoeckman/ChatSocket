security: 'solution to message duping in WS:
  include message ID (MID) in each message which contains: random part + Date.now()

  Server validates:
  1. Date.now() must be younger than 2 seconds!
  2. random part does not exist yet in memory (of last 2 seconds)

  Problem:
  attacker might forge MID with newer time

  Solution: encrypt whole message including MID
